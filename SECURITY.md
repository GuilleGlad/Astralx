# Security Summary - Sprint 0

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Sprint:** Sprint 0 - Infrastructure Setup

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Dependency Management ✅

- All dependencies installed from official npm registry
- Package-lock.json committed for reproducible builds
- Regular dependency versions (no wildcards in package.json)

### 2. Environment Security ✅

- `.env` file excluded from git via `.gitignore`
- `.env.example` provided as template (no sensitive data)
- Docker credentials for development only (documented)
- Database passwords for dev environment only (not production-ready)

### 3. Code Quality ✅

- ESLint configured for code quality checks
- TypeScript strict mode ready for implementation
- Git hooks prevent committing unformatted code
- Conventional commits enforced

### 4. API Security ✅

- CORS ready to be configured in production
- JWT authentication ready for Sprint 1
- OpenAPI documentation doesn't expose sensitive data
- Health check endpoint is public (intentional)

### 5. Database Security ✅

- Sample data uses dummy password hashes (development only)
- Initial schema doesn't include sensitive data
- MySQL configured for local development only
- Production credentials to be managed via environment variables

### 6. Docker Security ✅

- Images use official base images (node:20-alpine, mysql:8.0, redis:7-alpine)
- No secrets in docker-compose.yml
- Network isolation between services
- Health checks configured

## Known Vulnerabilities

### Development Dependencies (Moderate Severity)

**Issue:** Koa 3.0.1-3.0.2 - Open Redirect via Trailing Double-Slash

- **Severity:** Moderate
- **Location:** @nx/react-native dependencies (module federation)
- **CVSS:** Not specified
- **Status:** Known issue, monitoring

**Analysis:**

- Affects `@module-federation` packages used by Nx for micro-frontend features
- Our project does NOT use module federation
- Only present in development dependencies
- Risk: **LOW** - Development tool only, not in production bundle
- Mitigation: Monitor for Nx updates that resolve this

**Action Plan:**

- ✅ Documented in this security summary
- ⏳ Monitor Nx releases for updates
- ⏳ Re-evaluate in Sprint 1 or when Nx updates

### Production Dependencies

**Status:** ✅ No known vulnerabilities in production dependencies

## Security Best Practices for Future Sprints

### Sprint 1 - Authentication

- [ ] Implement bcrypt for password hashing (10+ rounds)
- [ ] Use strong JWT secrets (generated, not hardcoded)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints
- [ ] Add CORS configuration for production
- [ ] Implement password complexity requirements
- [ ] Add account lockout after failed attempts

### Sprint 2+ - Data Protection

- [ ] Implement input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add SQL injection protection (use parameterized queries)
- [ ] Implement XSS protection
- [ ] Add CSRF protection for sensitive operations
- [ ] Implement data encryption at rest for sensitive fields
- [ ] Add audit logging for security events

### Infrastructure Security

- [ ] Use secrets management service (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)
- [ ] Implement SSL/TLS certificates for production
- [ ] Configure security headers (helmet.js)
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Use non-root Docker users in production images

## Security Tools

### Currently Configured ✅

- npm audit (dependency scanning)
- ESLint (code quality)
- Git hooks (pre-commit checks)

### Recommended for Future Sprints

- [ ] Snyk or Dependabot for automated vulnerability scanning
- [ ] SonarQube for code quality and security analysis
- [ ] OWASP ZAP for security testing
- [ ] Trivy for Docker image scanning

## Environment-Specific Security

### Development ✅

- Sample credentials clearly marked as dev-only
- Local-only database access
- No external services exposed

### Production (Future)

- [ ] Use managed database services with encryption
- [ ] Implement WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- [ ] Use managed secrets (not environment variables in code)
- [ ] Enable database audit logging
- [ ] Implement backup and disaster recovery
- [ ] Set up security monitoring and alerts

## Compliance Considerations

For future implementation:

- **GDPR**: User data privacy, right to deletion
- **Data Retention**: Define policies for user data
- **Audit Trails**: Log security-relevant events
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC)

## Incident Response Plan

To be developed in future sprints:

- Security incident identification
- Response procedures
- Communication plan
- Post-incident review process

## Responsible Disclosure

For security issues in production (future):

- Create security@astralx.com email
- Establish security reporting process
- Define response timelines
- Plan for security advisories

## Conclusion

**Sprint 0 Security Status:** ✅ **ACCEPTABLE**

- No critical or high-severity vulnerabilities in production dependencies
- Known moderate vulnerabilities are in development tools only
- Security best practices followed for infrastructure setup
- Clear path forward for implementing production security measures
- All sensitive data clearly marked as development-only

**Ready for Sprint 1** with security considerations documented.
